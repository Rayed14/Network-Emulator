# Network-Emulator
This repository presents a network emulator project that utilizes various data structures, including linked lists and graphs, to create a realistic network environment. The project focuses on implementing a routing table and leveraging it to determine the next hop for network packets, ultimately simulating a functional network emulator.

Welcome to the Network Emulator project! This repository contains a network emulator implemented using various data structures, including linked lists and graphs, to create a realistic network environment. The project focuses on building a routing table and utilizing it to determine the next hop for network packets, allowing for the emulation of a functional network.

# Features
* Construction of a routing table based on network topology and routing algorithms.
* Packet forwarding based on the routing table to determine the optimal path for network packets.
* Network emulation capabilities to simulate packet transmission, network congestion, and other network behaviors.
* Interactive environment for studying network protocols, performance evaluation, and network analysis.
* Efficient data structures such as linked lists and graphs for managing the routing table and modeling network topology.
# Requirements
To run the network emulator, you need the following:

A compatible programming environment or IDE that supports the programming language used for implementation (e.g., C++, Python).
Any required dependencies or libraries, if applicable.
Getting Started
To get started with the Network Emulator, follow these steps:

bash
Copy code
cd network-emulator
Set up your development environment and ensure all dependencies are installed.

Run the network emulator, c++ file using the appropriate IDE like visual studio

Explore the emulator's functionality and interact with the simulated network environment
